VECTOCOLOR
This function converts a vector of N values into an Nx3 matrix of color
values according to the current colormap. It automatically scales the 
vector to provide maximum dynamic range for the color map.

Usage:
  colors = vectocolor(vector, cmap=None)

where:
  colors is an Nx4 list of RGB-alpha color values
  vector is the input vector (or list, it's converted to an array; or a scalar)
  cmap is the colormap (default: jet)

Example:
	n=1000
	x=randn(n,1);
	y=randn(n,1);
	c=vectocolor(y);
	scatter(x,y,20,c)

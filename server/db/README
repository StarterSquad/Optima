------------------------------------------

Database migrations are setup to be done automatically during deploy. To run them yourself, do the following:

* pip install sqlalchemy-migrate

* cd <your-git-root>/Optima/server/db

* migrate version_control postgresql://optima:optima@localhost:5432/optima server/db/

this initiates the migration in your local DB.

When you want to create new migration script, do:

* migrate sql_script postgresql://optima:optima@localhost:5432/optima <migration_name> server/db/

This will create two empty files with names like 00X_<migration_name>_(down|up)grade.sql. These are upgrade and downgrade migration, correspondingly. Edit them accordingly.

To run the migration, do:

* migrate upgrade postgresql://optima:optima@localhost:5432/optima server/db/

To undo the migration, do: 

* migrate downgrade postgresql://optima:optima@localhost:5432/optima server/db/

Setup Database
------------

For the development environment setup Optima needs to use a Postgres database created using:

- name: `optima`
- host: `localhost`
- port: `5432`
- username: `optima`
- password: `optima`

Setup Migrations
------------

Database migrations are setup to be done automatically during deploy. To run them yourself, do the following:

    pip install sqlalchemy-migrate psycopg2

    cd <your-git-root>/Optima/

    migrate version_control postgresql://optima:optima@localhost:5432/optima server/db/

this initiates the migration in your local DB.


Create Migration Script
------------

When you want to create new migration script, do:

    migrate script_sql postgresql <migration_name> server/db/

This will create two empty files with names like 00X_<migration_name>_(down|up)grade.sql. These are upgrade and downgrade migration, correspondingly. Edit them accordingly.


Run Migrations
------------

To run the migration, do:

    migrate upgrade postgresql://optima:optima@localhost:5432/optima server/db/

To undo the migration, do:

    # Usage: migrate downgrade URL REPOSITORY_PATH VERSION
    migrate downgrade postgresql://optima:optima@localhost:5432/optima server/db/ 0

CAVEAT. If you applied the previous migrations manually, you have to update the migrate_version table: 

    update migrate_version set version=<previous version>;

I.e. if you want to apply migration 3 and your database already has all previous migrations, verify that migrate_version.version=2 before running migrations.

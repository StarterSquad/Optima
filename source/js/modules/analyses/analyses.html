  <h1>Analyses</h1>


  <h2>1. Project Outcomes.</h2>

  <h3>1a. Projection of Epidemic Dynamics.</h3>
  New infections over time, by population and overall (line graph).

  <h3>1b. Projection of Epidemic Dynamics.</h3>
  New infections by population (stacked bars).

  <h3>1c. Projection of Epidemic Dynamics.</h3>
  HIV incidence - as 1b, but per capita instead of absolute values.

  <h2>2. Optimize Outcomes.</h2>

  <h3>2a. Intervention Impact/cost-effectiveness.</h3>
  For different programmatic spending scenarios.

  <h3>2b. Intervention Impact/cost-effectiveness.</h3>
  HIV infections averted in different time periods.

  <h2>3. Minimize money</h2>

  <h3>3a. Fixed-budget optimization.</h3>
  Optimal resource allocation within the AIDS response budget to achieve a defined impact.

  <h3>3b. Fixed-outcome optimization.</h3>
  Includes assumptions on program coverage over time.

  <h3>3c. Optimization: various budgets.</h3>
  Optimal resource allocation across programs at different funding levels.

  <h3>3d. Optimization: corresponding outcome indicator(s) relevant to 3c.</h3>
  
  <h3>3e. Optimization: cumulative healthcare costs over time.</h3>
  Includes assumptions of treatment coverage over time.

  <h3>3f. Optimization: Annual care costs over time.</h3>
  Includes assumptions of treatment coverage over time.

  <h3>3g. Optimization: Health care commitments for current PLHIV.</h3>
  User to set ART coverage target.

  <h3>3h. Optimization: Health care commitments for future PLHIV.</h3>
  User to set ART coverage target.

  <h3>3i. Optimization: Incidence (or prevalence) over time.</h3>
  User choice of spending scenarios incl. optimal.

  <h3>3j. Optimization: AIDS deaths (or DALYs) over time.</h3>
  User choice of spending scenarios incl. optimal.

  <h3>3k. Costs caused by one new HIV infection.</h3>

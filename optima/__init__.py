This file performs all necessary imports, so Optima can be used either as

from .optima import Project, Parameters [etc.] [preferred]
or
import optima as op
or
from .optima import *

The __init__.py file imports all functions and classes defined in this file..

Since other functions import optima.py and optima.py imports other functions, 
weird race conditions can happen. Thus, it's designed to silently fail once
it gets up to the latest module that it can successfully import. To make it
fail loudly, do a find-and-replace for "pass #" with blank to re-enable the
print statements.

I'm sorry this file is so ugly. Believe me, it hurts me more than it hurts you.

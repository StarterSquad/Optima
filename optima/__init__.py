This file performs all necessary imports, so Optima can be used either as

from optima import Project, Parameters [etc.]
or
import optima as op
or
from optima import *

Note: do NOT modify this file directly; instead, modify optima.py -- this allows
Optima to be used from inside this directory, whereas otherwise everything would
have to be imported from the individual modules.
